## Notes about this project
- This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).
- The purpose of this project was to implement Modules alongside with Webpack to bundle them up and create a dist folder for a production build.

## My journey through this project
- This was a pretty straightforward project that I followed alongside - a few notable hardest parts of this project was the design of the website and making sure that all of the files I needed were showing up in the dist directory.

## Thoughts about this project
- This was a great first project for beginners (like myself) to learn how to set up and use Webpack in my working environment.
